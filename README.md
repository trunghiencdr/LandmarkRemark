# 🌍 Landmark Remark Project 🌍

This is an Android application developed in Kotlin that uses the Mapbox SDK. The app allows users to interact with a map, add notes at their current location, view notes added by others, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- **📍 Show Current Location**: The app uses GPS to accurately display the user's current location on the map.
- **📝 Add Note**: Users can add a note at their current location. These notes are then visible on the map.
- **👁️ View Note**: Any notes added will be visible to the user. They can view the details of the note by clicking on it on the map.
- **🗑️ Delete Note**: Users have the ability to delete any notes they have created.
- **🔒 Login/Logout**: The app includes user authentication. Users can create an account, login, and logout.
- **⏱️ Real-Time Updates**: The app updates in real-time. When a note is added or deleted, the map will update immediately without needing to refresh.
- **👥 View Other User's Notes**: Users can view notes added by other users.
